# latina
Latina is an application that can take a Latin word and transform it into Spanish, making it undergo all the regular phonetic changes.
To use it, simply input a word in minuscule characters and add a double colon (':') to mark a vowel as long.
It might be made to work with other target languages in the future. Currently works with Spanish only.
